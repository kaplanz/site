Great progress on [Rugby]'s iOS app these last few weeks:

- Fully updated to iOS 26
- Added sound to the port (long missing)
- Added a welcome screen
- Organized app settings
- Support for custom palettes
- Support shaders for LCD (using Metal)

An unnecessary but cool feature I added is that the icons now match the chosen
colour palette. This uses some PNG witchcraft I'll write about soon in another
short post.

I also created pixel art to be used when missing a screenshot. Here's what it
looks like:

<figure>
  <img
    src="/img/usr/e6d847c7.png"
    width="250"
    style="image-rendering: pixelated;"
  />
  <figcaption>
    Pixel art for titles otherwise missing an icon (screenshot).
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Finally, last night I was able to improve performance by 2x[^perf] using this
one weird trick![^trick]

[^perf]:  In this instance, 2x means either (1) emulate at real speed using half
    the CPU time, or (2) double the maximum possible speed with the same CPU
    time.
[^trick]: Post pending. Talk to your local profiler to see if weird
    optimizations are for you.
