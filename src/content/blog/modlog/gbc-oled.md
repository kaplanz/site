I recently bought and modded my Game Boy Color with [Hispeedido][dev]'s [AMOLED
Display Kit][kit]. In this post I will document the process and my experience.

## Parts

I bought [this][kit] kit from AliExpress. This being my first time using the
platform, I was a little unsure of how shipping would work (both in terms of
time and cost), but everything went really smoothly. Included in this kit is
almost everything I needed:

- AMOLED display (sourced from old Blackberrys)
- USB-C rechargeable battery module
- Replacement shell, trimmed to fit the display and battery
  - Back-face label sticker
  - Buttons and membranes
  - Screws and hardware
- Screwdrivers
  - Y1 (triwing)
  - Phillips #1

    Here's everything I used for this project. Besides the soldering iron,
    cleaning supplies, and donor GBC, everything else came from the kit.

My soldering iron is a FNIRSI HS-02A, which I've found to be a decent (but not
perfect) portable soldering station.[^lefty] For cleaning, I used 99% isopropyl
alcohol with Q-tips and a toothbrush.

[^lefty]: For example, the stand is completely unergonomic if you're
    left-handed.

## Result

Here is the completed project:

I'm really happy with how it turned out! This was a great learning experience
and a relatively simple introduction to retro modding.
