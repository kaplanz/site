When Toronto's Indie88 ([CIND-FM]) first launched on 31 July 2013, they started
off the station by played was [Ready to Start][ready] by Arcade Fire. As my
high-school radio (and band) of choice, I find it appropriate for this blog's
debut post to start the same way.

knows where this'll go over time. This post is mostly just one of those scrap
pieces of paper where you doodle to brainstorm ideas, as such, it may be a bit
of a mess.
