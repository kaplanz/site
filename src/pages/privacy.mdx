## Data Collection

Wherever possible, this website strives not to collect data from its end users.
The following is all data that is intentionally collected.

### Analytics

Analytics are non-tracking and non-identifying; they only include basic
information about the region from which the request originated. Cloudflare
collects these analytics when pages are requested.

### Tracelogs

Some pages (e.g. `/books`, `/likes`, etc.) may make additional API requests to
fetch content. These requests may be logged to a console. Logs are retained for
an unspecified period, but are typically not stored long term.

## Data Storage

All collected data is stored at one of the following locations:

| Purpose   | Vendor              | Location     |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Analytics | Cloudflare, Inc.    | Various      |
| Tracelogs | Hetzner Online GmbH | Helsinki, FI |

## Data Usage

- **Analytics** are used solely for understanding website demographics. This is
  primarily to identify statistics and trends of visitors' country of origin,
  and cannot be used to track individual visitors.
- **Tracelogs** are rarely accessed and are usually only enabled for debugging
  purposes. They may be checked if there is suspicion of malicious
  cyber-activity.

## Data Access

Only I (Zakhary Kaplan) have access to any of this data. I will never willingly
share collected data with additional parties without your express permission.

## Disclaimers

> [!CAUTION]
>
> As a client of Cloudflare, this website's end users may also be subject to
> Cloudflare's [Privacy Policy](https://cloudflare.com/privacypolicy).
