## Collection

Wherever possible, this website strives not to collect data from its end-users.
The following is all data that is consciously collected.

### Analytics

Analytics are collected by Cloudflare when pages are requested. These analytics
are both non-tracking and non-identifying other than basic information about the
region from where the request was initiated.

### Tracelogs

Some pages (e.g. `/books`, `/likes`, etc.) may make additional API requests to
fetch content. These events may be logged to a console. Logs are retained for an
unspecified period of time but are typically not intentionally stored long-term.

## Data Storage

All collected data is stored at one of the following locations:

| Purpose   | Vendor              | Location     |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Analytics | Cloudflare, Inc.    | Various      |
| Tracelogs | Hetzner Online GmbH | Helsinki, FI |

## Data Usage

- **Analytics** are used solely for understanding website demographics. This is
  mostly to identify statistics and trends of visitors' country of origin, and
  cannot be used to track individual visitors.
- **Tracelogs** are rarely accessed and are usually only enabled for debugging
  purposes. They may be checked if there is suspicion of malicious
  cyber-activity.

## Data Access

Only myself (Zakhary Kaplan) has access to any of this data. I will never
willingly share any collected data with additional parties without your express
permission.

## Disclaimers

> [!CAUTION]
>
> As a client of Cloudflare, end-users of this website may additionally be
> subject to its [privacy policy](https://cloudflare.com/privacypolicy)
