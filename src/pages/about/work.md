## Intel

I'm currently employed as an FPGA Architect at Intel's Programmable Solutions
Group (PSG), formerly Altera. In this role I am responsible for helping design
and model our next generation Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
architectures.

## Qualcomm

Between my third and fourth year of studies, I had the amazing opportunity to
complete a 16-month long internship at [Qualcomm][qualcomm] as a computer
architect. During this time, I've had the opportunity to solve interesting and
challenging problems working on the Snapdragon's digital signal processor (DSP).

In this role, I diagrammed and reasoned about the design of a multi-client cache
system, after which I created a functional and transaction-level cycle-accurate
performance model of the cache. This model is being used to provide power
estimates as part of the architecture's specification, and will be used together
with detailed schematics in the ASIC design of this module.

My latest project involves researching various high-level synthesis (HLS)
workflows for our team to help improve the time-to-market latency within our
team.

I am especially grateful to my supervisors for all the experience, guidance, and
wisdom they have provided me throughout my internship!

## Geomechanica

In the summer of 2020, I worked as a software developer for
[Geomechanica][geomecha], an engineering company that develops simulation
software for rock mechanics. During this time, I had the opportunity to solve
complex problems developing features for Irazu, their geomechanical simulation
software.

Some of the most interesting projects I worked on involved the design and
creation of various tools to edit and make CAD models to run within the
simulator. I got to apply linear algebra to solve and render complex
visualizations of the engine's outputs, and worked on improving the
user-experience managing project creation.

As well, I learned hands-on about how software-enforced licensing works and
implemented several improvements to the existing licensing system. These
considerations have been tremendously helpful in furthering my general
understanding of computer security.
