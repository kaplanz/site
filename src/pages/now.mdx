## Life

Living in Kingston, ON since mid-2023. Occasionally commuting to Toronto for
work/to visit people.

### Travel

Starting to plan our upcoming trip to Japan (in around a year).

### Gaming

- Just bought a SNES so I can finally play my Super Game Boy. The shell is
  _really_ yellowed (and chipped). I'm not sure if it's worth buying a
  replacement. (Why do they cost like C$80?)
- I ~really need to play~ just finished Deltarune chapters 3-4. I highly
  recommend it.
- Hoping to ~steal~ borrow someone's Switch 2 because Mario Kart World looks
  really fun.

### Reading

Finishing up with Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere; only 3 books to go. Hopefully I
can make progress on my [backlog](/books?list=next) once I finish in a few
months. Next up probably some non-fiction.

## Code

- **Rugby**: Still working on my [Game Boy Emulator][rugby], but taking a brief
  break to update this site. I hope to get back to within the month and work on
  the iOS port. I also want to finally implement save states.
- **Website**: Not sure if it's worth abandoning Astro for either another SSG
  (yet again...) or finally building the bespoke system I've been considering
  for a while.
