## Life

Living in Kingston, ON since mid-2023. Occasionally commuting to Toronto for
work/to visit people.

### Travel

Starting to plan our upcoming trip to Japan next July!

### Gaming

- Mother 3 (fan translation)

### Reading

- _The Sunlit Man_[^cosmere]
- _Dracula Daily_[^dracula]

Next up: Probably some non-fiction from my [backlog](/books?list=next).


[^cosmere]: Almost finished with Brandon Sanderson's _Cosmere_.
[^dracula]: If you haven't heard of this, it's an interesting format where Bram
    Stoker's famous epistolary[^epistol] novel _Dracula_ is delivered and read
    chronologiclly as as a mailing list each year between May and November.
    Check it out [here][dracula].
[^epistol]: "(of a literary work) in the form of letters"

## Code

- **Rugby**: Still working on my [Game Boy Emulator][rugby], but taking a brief
  break to update this site. I hope to get back to within the month and work on
  the iOS port. I also want to finally implement save states.
