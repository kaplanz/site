## Life

Living in Kingston, ON since mid-2023. Occasionally commuting to Toronto for
work/to visit people.

### Travel

We just bought tickets our upcoming trip to Japan next July!

### Gaming

- Mother 3 (fan translation)
- The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages

### Reading

- _Elantris_[^cosmere]
- _Dracula Daily_[^dracula]

Next up: Probably some non-fiction from my [backlog](/books?list=next).

[^cosmere]: Almost finished with Brandon Sanderson's _Cosmere_.
[^dracula]: If you haven't heard of this, it's an interesting format where Bram
    Stoker's famous epistolary[^epistol] novel _Dracula_ is delivered and read
    chronologiclly as as a mailing list each year between May and November.
    Check it out [here][dracula].
[^epistol]: "(of a literary work) in the form of letters"

## Code

- **Rugby**: Working on my [Game Boy Emulator][rugby], specifically on the iOS
  port. It now supports sound and save RAM files. I also want to finally
  implement save states soon.
