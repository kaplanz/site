## Life

Living in Kingston, ON since mid-2023. Occasionally commuting to Toronto for
work/to visit people.

### Travel

Starting to plan our upcoming trip to Japan next July!

### Gaming

- Currently playing: Mother 3 (fan translation).

### Reading

Finishing up with Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere; I'm just about finished with Wind
and Truth.

Hopefully I can make progress on my [backlog](/books?list=next) once I finish in
a few months. Next up probably some non-fiction.

## Code

- **Rugby**: Still working on my [Game Boy Emulator][rugby], but taking a brief
  break to update this site. I hope to get back to within the month and work on
  the iOS port. I also want to finally implement save states.
