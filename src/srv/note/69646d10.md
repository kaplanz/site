I just finished porting my site to [Eleventy][11ty]. Overall it feels like it
gives a lot more freedom over the markup &rarr; HTML pipeline. As a less
opinionated tool,[^opine] it's also nice that I can structure my project however I want.

[^opine]: But, you know, that's just, like, my opinion, man.

There are probably a few quirks I'll need to fix over the coming days, but I'm
happy with the result!
