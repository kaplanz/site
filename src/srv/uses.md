## Hardware

- **Laptop**: Macbook Pro (14-inch, 2021)[^model]
  - **Processor**: M1 Pro
  - **Memory**: 16 GB
  - **Storage**: 512 GB
- **Docking**: CalDigit TS4
  - **Display**: 2&times; LG 27UP850N-W[^duals]
  - **Keyboard**: Keychron V1[^keebs]
  - **Mouse**: Logitech Signature M650[^mouse]
  - **Speaker**: Creative Pebble V2
  - **Webcam**: Anker PowerConf C200

[^model]: The base model with **no upgrades** is all I feel most people need
    (unless you're doing audio/photo/video editing). If I were buying a laptop
    today I'd get the base MacBook Air.
[^macos]: I'm an OS X/macOS user since 2013. I strongly believe modern Windows is
    bloatware.
[^linux]: Usually [Void Linux][void] given the choice. I generally prefer
    rolling releases and doing more things myself. I have aversion to `systemd`
    from something I read online ages ago, but don't have any real technical
    reasons with which I justify that preference.
[^duals]: I don't believe in having more than 2 monitors. Fight me over it if you
    want, but it doesn't work well for 99.9% of use-cases. (And no, your
    use-case is not in the 0.1%.)
[^keebs]: I love the 75% layout, it has just the right amount of keys. Recently
    I've been eyeing a NuPhy.
[^mouse]: Actively looking for something more ergonomic that won't break the
    bank. Suggestions welcome!

## Software

- **Operating System**: macOS for workstations,[^macos] Linux for servers[^linux]
- **Text Editor/IDE**: Neovim[^nvim]
- **Terminal Emulator**: Ghostty[^term]
- **Shell**: Zsh[^fish]

[^nvim]: I switched from Vim to Neovim in 2021 and haven't looked back. For
    beginners I used to recommend VSCode, but not since Microsoft [EEE]'d it.
[^term]: My terminal emulator journey roughly went: Terminal.app &rarr; iTerm2
    &rarr; WezTerm &rarr; Ghostty.
[^fish]: Although I'm a little [fish] curious.
