#### Life

- Living in Kingston, ON since mid-2023. Occasionally commuting to Toronto for
  work/to visit people.
- Mentally preparing to move in a few months. Where to? Good question.

##### Travel

- Planning for our upcoming Japan trip this summer. There's so much to figure
  out still...

#### Code

- [**Emulator**][emu]: Taking a brief break. When I return I'll likely either
  continue working the iOS port, bring back debugging to the CLI, or finally
  implement save states.
- [**Website**][site]: Just finished porting this site to [Eleventy][11ty]. I
  should probably write the colophon now.

##### Forge

I've been considering either migrating to Codeberg or self-hosting my own git
interface (probably something simpler, like [cgit]).
