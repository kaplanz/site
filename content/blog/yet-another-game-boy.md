title: Yet Another Game Boy
---

21 April, 1989. A console is born. It's a (Game) Boy!

Now to say this console was influential would be a gross understatement,
considering 118.69 million units were sold worldwide[^1]. Heck, it was so
important that the Game Boy reigned supreme in the Nintendo lineup up until
2003, a whopping 14 years later. Now, here we are in 2022, and I have decided to
grace the world with the emulator it needed, but doesn't deserve. Introducing,
yet another Game Boy emulator&trade;.

<!-- more -->

Running on a ~~Zilog Z80~~ Sharp LR35902 and clocking in at 4 MiHz, this console
has been emulated by anyone and everyone who thought they could be original.
There's even an entire [online community][gbdev] dedicated to "developing
homebrew games, emulators and documentation" for it. Shout out to Nintendo for
not issuing a DCMA takedown (please don't jinx me).
