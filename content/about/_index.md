I'm a fourth year Computer Engineering student studying at the University of
Toronto. In my spare time, I like to tinker with whatever technology I can get
my hands on. My interests are generally in the world of computer hardware, but
I find most things digital fascinating.

Explore this site see what I've been up to, and feel free to check back for
whatever hot takes or tidbits I found interesting enough to write about.
